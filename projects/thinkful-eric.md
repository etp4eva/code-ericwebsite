## Purpose

I like to meditate. I do it every day. It helps me control my thoughts and provides a fertile mental state for creativity. My meditation process is simple but I have struggled to find a free app that provides for my needs without also cluttering it with things that I don't need. 

## Features

My meditation app, ThinkfulEric (coming soon to the Google Play store), is everything that I want and nothing more. It provides a simple countdown timer where additional chimes can be added at any interval you wish if you like a progressive meditation. In addition it records your meditations in a log along with few basic notes about the experience and your state of mind that you can write in if you wish.

I wrote it using **Expo** so it can run on every major platform easily. For now I am targeting Android devices but anybody can clone the repo and build it for iOS if they wish.

## Technology

I used **Expo** because it provides a nice framework for development. I didn't need to write any native code for this project so there was no need to eject it. Much of the code you write is as you would for **React Native** which I enjoy working with as I am already familiar with **React**. Expo provides **TypeScript** support out of the box which I appreciate as well.

This was a fairly simple project but I have some ambitions for mobile development and so have already begun to dip my toe into writing pure native code in **Kotlin**.
