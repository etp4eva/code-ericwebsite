Hello! my name is **Eric Pledger**. I am a **software developer** and **data analyst** currently living in **Paris, France**. I love using new technologies to make beautiful things happen with computers.

My experience writing software varies from making simple games and tools in **C++** and **OpenGL** to writing modern mobile and web applications with **TypeScript**, **Expo**, **Next.js**, **Node.js** and **Python**. I enjoy the creative challenge that comes with writing code that is functional, performant, and elegant to create something new and even innovative.

In addition to writing code, computer systems have long been of interest to me. I have set up a number of Linux home servers over the years for personal projects, gaming, and NAS and I like trying out the new technologies that run the web. DevOps and orchestration is a fascinating world to me.

While I love working with computers, my overriding passion is nature and the outdoors. In my spare time I like hiking and climbing. I also like art and literature and I have been obsessed with photography for more than 20 years ever since my dad gave me his Canon FTb.
